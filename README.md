# TheEnigma

The Enigma machines are a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines, mainly developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I.

The Enigmas effect a substitution cipher on the letters of a message. That is, at any given time, the machine performs a permutation—a one-to-one mapping—of the alphabet onto itself. The alphabet consists solely of the 26 letters in one case (there were various conventions for spaces and punctuation).
